## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!

```{r, include=FALSE}
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
ct <- house_elections %>%
  filter(state == "CT") %>%
  select(-fec_id, -incumbent, -state) %>%
  group_by(party) %>%
  arrange(district)
  
ct

ct_party <- ct %>%
  summarize(N = n(),
            dist1 = sum(ifelse(district == '01', 1, 0)),
            dist2 = sum(ifelse(district == '02', 1, 0)),
            dist3 = sum(ifelse(district == '03', 1, 0)),
            dist4 = sum(ifelse(district == '04', 1, 0)),
            dist5 = sum(ifelse(district == '05', 1, 0)),
            primary = sum(primary_votes),
            general = sum(general_votes))

ct_party
