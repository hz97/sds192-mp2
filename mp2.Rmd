## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!

```{r, include=FALSE}
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
ct <- house_elections %>%
  filter(state == "CT") %>%
  select(-c(fec_id, incumbent, state))
  
ct
```
